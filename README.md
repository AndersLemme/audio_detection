# audio_detection

Since I have worked with this project localy i have stored and tested loads of things with different audio files different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models.
Also I have created scripts to collect data with different methods. And tried to implement semi-working CNN to collect data with a better filter than amplitude threshold.
So i decided to be more structured and created this Repo for Anomaly detection in audio.
